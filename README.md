## About the Author
Hello! I’m known as Hummus-Ful, inspired by one of my favorite dishes—a vegan-friendly stew made with cooked fava beans and creamy tahini blended with mashed chickpeas.

I work in Information Security and focus on network-related topics daily. However, I often find that my work leans more towards the theoretical side. To bridge this gap, I sought to gain more hands-on experience.
I’ve turned to intentionally vulnerable machines hosted by platforms like **Vulnhub , TryHackMe, and Hack The Box**. These services offer a controlled environment where I can practice hacking skills freely (well… almost!).

## About the Blog
The Information Security community is incredibly supportive, and newcomers are always welcome. I remember my early years in the industry, where I learned a great deal from the generous sharing of knowledge by experienced community members—often at no cost. I aim for this blog to embody that spirit by providing accessible, easy-to-understand, entry-level (and beyond) knowledge for free. Each post is crafted to be as informative as possible, breaking down complex commands into manageable pieces. When additional reading is necessary, I include links to external resources. The content here primarily consists of my notes from my experiences on TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and VulnHub.

That said, I want to emphasize that ALL INFORMATION IN THIS BLOG IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. HACKING IS ILLEGAL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXPLICIT CONSENT FROM THE TARGET OWNER. STAY SAFE, STAY OUT OF JAIL, AND USE THE PLATFORMS MENTIONED ABOVE.

Keep Learning - Continuous learning is essential in this field. You’ll likely need to explore various resources to expand your knowledge. If you have suggestions for materials that could help others learn, please let me know!
